                        "The acquisition of companies, intellectual property and talented individuals has been central
                        to our growth strategy. In 2010, we acquired TSI and its subsidiaries in order to expand our B2B
                        business, particularly our international air ticketing for small and medium scale enterprises.
                        In 2012, we acquired Travelguru B2B and B2C entities from Travelocity, which remain
                        well-established hotel aggregators in India. Through this acquisition, we expanded our hotel
                        business by establishing more direct hotel relationships in India and improved our inventory of
                        affordable travel options. Recently, we also acquired Air Travel Bureau Ltd. ("ATB"), India's
                        largest independent corporate travel services provider to further strengthen our position in the
                        growing corporate travel market in India. Now, with this combined entity, Yatra is the largest
                        corporate travel services platform in India by Gross Bookings. We have also leveraged our
                        leading position in the Indian travel ecosystem to make several "acqui-hires", including the
                        teams from mGaadi and dudegenie, in order to grow our business.
